If given a script, the corresponding interpreter (such as the Bash interpreter, the Python interpreter, or the R interpreter) will execute all the instructions contained in the script in order from the first line to the last line. In other words, a script is a *program* that is written in an interpreted programming language (as opposed to *compiled* programming language such as C, C++, and Java)."
